# Installing things
## Windows
Please see the windows installation guide written by the brilliant [Andy
Russell](https://github.com/euclio).

For Day 1, you will only to install git.

## OSX
###  Sublime Text 2
Download it [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

### Git and Developer Tools
The Command Line Tools have a lot of really nice things for development, like
git, python, gcc and make. It is *highly* recommended that you install the
Command Line Tools instead of installing these components manually.

They take awhile to install, so try to do this before the tutorial.

1.  Download Xcode [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
2.  Open up Xcode.
3.  In the top menu, navigate to Xcode -> Preferences.
4.  Click the Downloads tab. Then click the Components tab.
5.  Click install for "Command Line Tools".

You can verify that the Command Line Tools are installed by going to Terminal
and typing:

    $ git --version
